    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>From combat boots to computers</h2>
    <p>My name is Bryson and I'm taking the Eleven Fifty Academy Web Dev course. I spent 12 years of my life in the Army prior to deciding to make this career change. During my time in the Army I served in an Airborne Infantry unit. My unit deployed multiple times
        before I decided it was time for me pursue other things. 
    </p>

    <h3>A glimpse of what I did in the service</h2>

    <h3>Some things I'm looking forward to in the course:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning a new language(essentially).</li>
        <li>A more direct project based approach to learning.</li>
        <li>Moving into an ever growing industry.</li>
    </ul>
